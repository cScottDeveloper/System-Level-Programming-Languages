if you use an @symbol in front of an object, it tells the class you want to use that variable in the object
if you use two @@symbols then you are referring to an object of the class

LOOPS:
using the two dots it will put them all on one line and include the 10(inclusive)
for i in 1..10 do
print i, " "
end
print "\n" can also use puts for a newline
output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

using three dots will not include the 10 (exclusive)
for i in 1...10 do
print i, " "
end
output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Fill method:
a.fill{ |x| x*10}
a.fill{5}

Yield notes:
means go to where it is called(the method is called) and yield that result back to the method
